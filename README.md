[Watch this script in action](https://youtu.be/iOiwRt_P95Y)

Easily install Cisco Packet Tracer latest version on Fedora. This installation script automatically detects a Cisco Packet Tracer `.deb` in any directory on user home.

## Install

Follow these steps to easily install:

-   Download the Packet Tracer installer from [Cisco's download page](https://www.netacad.com/resources/lab-downloads?courseLang=en-US) and save it in any directory on `/home` using the default filename.
-   Clone this repo to your system
-   `cd` into the cloned repo and make the install script executable: `chmod +x setup.sh`
-   Run `bash setup.sh` **or** `sudo bash setup.sh` and relax. If you not use `sudo`, you will receive no permission alerts when the script looks for installers on you HOME.

Now, the script accepts these command line options:
- `-d` or `--directory` allows you to specify a path to the installer. This can make the script faster, preventing large searches of the `/home` directory;
- `-h` will show help about the script;
- `--uninstall` uninstall the installed Cisco Packet Tracer.
